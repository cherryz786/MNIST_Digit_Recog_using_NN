# MNIST Digit Prediction using Neural Network

## Overview

The MNIST Digit Prediction project is a classic example of image classification using machine learning techniques. It focuses on recognizing and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from a dataset of grayscale images. This README provides an overview of the project, the dataset, and the libraries used.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset, short for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology," serves as the foundation for this project. It contains a total of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into two sets:

- Training Set: 60,000 images
- Test Set: 10,000 images

Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, resulting in 784 total pixels. The pixel values are preprocessed and normalized to fall within the range [0, 1].

## Libraries Used

To build and analyze the MNIST Digit Prediction system, we imported several Python libraries, including:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization and plotting.
- `seaborn`: Enhances data visualization with a high-level interface.
- `cv2` (OpenCV): Used for computer vision tasks and image processing.
- `PIL` (Pillow): For image handling and manipulation.
- `tensorflow`: The core library for building and training machine learning models.
- `keras`: A high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.
- `tensorflow.math.confusion_matrix`: To calculate confusion matrices for model evaluation.

We also set a random seed using `tf.random.set_seed(3)` to ensure reproducible results for our experiments.

## Project Structure

The project typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset, including normalization.

2. **Model Selection**: Choosing an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for digit classification. Common choices include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests.

3. **Data Splitting**: Splitting the dataset into a training set for model training and a test set for evaluation.

4. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the training data to learn digit patterns and features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model hyperparameters for optimal performance.

7. **Predictions**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images.

8. **Deployment**: Deploying the model in applications requiring digit recognition.
